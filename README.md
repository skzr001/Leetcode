# Leetcode
This is my note about Leetcode experience.</br>

I write this note in order to record the thinking process behind each problems.</br>

If you want to join my Leetcode group working on an intern or a full-time position,you could contact me!<br>

I hope this group is within 4-6 people that we could communicate well and do mock interview. If you are a Rutgers students, that's better!</br>
